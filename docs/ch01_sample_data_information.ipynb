    "* The voxels whose BOLD intensities were greater than 20% of the maximum BOLD intensity for each preprocessed fMRI volume were defined as an in-brain mask from the fMRI volume. Then, the in-brain mask that overlapped across all fMRI volumes and all subjects was used to define the final set of input voxels (Kim, J., et al., 2013 ;  Kim, J. and Lee, J.-H., 2013), resulting in a total of 74,484 in-brain voxels. \n",
